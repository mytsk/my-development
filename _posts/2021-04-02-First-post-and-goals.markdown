My goal is so deep dive in different dev-opsish technologies and I will try to document the progress along the way here. Some of the stuff may be very basic and somthings I probably already have  knowledge a about. But, for the sake of keeping it all together from start to end I feel like even the basic suff needs to go in here. 

Here's the list of what I _think_ I will go in to.

1. Pre-reqs
* SSH-keys
* Git
2. Technologies
* Ansible (and Tower)
* Terraform
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Vagrant
* Jenkins
* Vault
3. Language/Script/Code
* yaml
* PowerShell
* Python
* Go
* Ruby
* Jinja2
* Jekyll
4. Security
* STIX
* SCC
* OVAL
5. PKI
* Certificates
* Certificate Authority
* Key Management Services
